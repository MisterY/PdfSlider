PdfSlider is a demo project that shows a slider (carousel) for PDF documents.
It uses SlidesJS (http://slidesjs.com/) and PDFObject (http://pdfobject.com/) components.
PdfSlider is intended to be pure HTML5 implementation. So, just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowed. (CoffeeScript is JavaScript :).

I am using SamplePDF.com for generating a test PDF that is embedded in the page.
